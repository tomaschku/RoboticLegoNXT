libnxter is a collection of robot utilities for lego mindstorms nxt robotics kit,
written in NXC, and currently implements: integer matrix algebra (including
cofactor and inverse computation), low/high pass filter, PID control and
kalman filter. It can be directly used on the standard nxt firmware.

Note: The project started as libnxt, but was renamed to libnxter after
discovering an already existing project with similar name. SourceForge
doesn't make it easy to move project to different name.

Project: http://sourceforge.net/projects/libnxt

Source repository: http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=235071

You need http://bricxcc.sourceforge.net/ to use the library

You also need modified mindstorms nxt firmware flashed. Download it from
http://bricxcc.sourceforge.net/lms_arm_jch.zip and flash it normally.

libnxter development is blogged in my blog at:
