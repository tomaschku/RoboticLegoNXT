# RoboticLegoNXT
My adventures thru coding with the LEGO NXT in BricxCC.
Maybe my programs or the documentation help someone developing their own interest in the world of integrated devices.

Since I no longer have access to the required hardware and I don't expect this to become popular, the repository will be archived.
